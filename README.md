# REFUGE restrooms

Providing safe restroom access for transgender, intersex, and gender noncomforming individuals.

REFUGE is an effort to fill the hole left by the now-defunct Safe2Pee website. It provides a resource for trans\* and queer individuals in need of gender neutral and other safe restrooms.

This project is open source. Feel free to contribute. We could use the help.


## Set Up For Contributing
* [Enviroment Setup Wiki](https://github.com/RefugeRestrooms/refugerestrooms/wiki/Setting-up-the-Dev-Enviroment-for-Contributing-to-Refuge-Restrooms)
* [Assets Repo](https://github.com/RefugeRestrooms/refuge_assets)

## Deployment
Currently right now we deploy to heroku. Our application is small enough that it is free to host on Heroku, and we dont mind the server having to wake up if nobody has accessed the site in a while.

We have both a staging and a production instance on heroku. The staging instance can be found at http://refugestaging.herokuapp.com/

Here are the steps to deploy:
 1. Talk to @tkwidmer about getting access as a collaborator for both the production and staging heroku instances.
 2. Link your local repo to the heroku remote repos. I suggest doing it this way:
  * `git remote add production git@heroku.com:refugerestrooms.git`
  * `git remote add staging git@heroku.com:refugestaging.git`
 3. Merge changes into master.
 4. Pull master locally to make sure you have the latest changes. `git pull origin master`
 5. Push your changes to staging. `git push staging master`
  * run any migrations `heroku run rake db:migrate --remote staging`
 6. Verify your changes.
 7. Push your changes to production. `git push production master`
  * run any migrations `heroku run rake db:migrate --remote production`


### Testing

Please cover any new code with specs. We prefer code to be covered using RSpec or Capybara.
